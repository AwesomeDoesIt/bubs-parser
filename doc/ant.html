<h2>Ant</h2>

<p>Ant is a build tool, similar to make, but avoids make's classic
'spaces vs tabs' issue by using an XML format. The <i>build.xml</i> file
is Ant's equivalent of a <i>Makefile</i></p>

<p>Ant is extensible; tasks and types are all Java code, and it's
reasonably easy to write new ones. But most common tasks are already
handled cleanly by standard tasks, so it's unlikely you'll need to write
any custom extensions.</p>

<p>We'll focus here on the usage in our shared code. If you want
more information on Ant, see the Ant webpage at <a
	href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a> and the manual
at <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html">http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html</a>.</p>

<h3>Quick Start:</h3>
<p>Just cd into the shared-nlp-code root directory and type 'ant'.
This will run the default target, 'dist', which will compile all Java
and C code, package all standalone Java programs as standalone jars, and
create wrapper scripts for them. The resulting distribution files will
be in build-dist.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>The 'doc' target generates all the JavaDoc documentation and
packages all other docs (including this one) into the 'build-doc'
directory.</p>
