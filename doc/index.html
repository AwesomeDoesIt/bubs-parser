<h2>Shared NLP Code</h2>

<p>This project contains a variety of (hopefully) commonly useful
NLP tools, including data structures (trees, matrices, vectors, etc),
text-processing tools, exact and approximate matching algorithms, and
sequence alignment tools.</p>

<p>A limited number of C language tools are included, but the vast
majority of the code is implemented in Java. Each Java package is
described in more detail in the package <a href="javadoc/index.html">JavaDocs</a>.
