<p>Grammar data structures. Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) can be represented 
in many ways, and the representation choice often entails tradeoffs between memory footprint 
and query speed. Further, individual inference algorithms may depend explicitly on a particular 
representation. The classes in this package implement a variety of PCFG data structures, 
most of which are used by the parser implementations in edu.ohsu.cslu.parser and sub-packages.</p>
