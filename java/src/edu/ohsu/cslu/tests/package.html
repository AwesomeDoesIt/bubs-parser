<p>Extends <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> to support
optional performance testing as well as standard unit testing. Allows
test classes or methods to be annotated as performance tests. The
default behavior is to ignore such tests, but alternate filters can be
specified which will run arbitrary combinations of test types.</p>

<p>This package also contains the master test suite {@link
edu.ohsu.cslu.tests.SharedNlpTests} which runs the entire regression
test suite.</p>
