<p>CYK chart storage data structures. All {@link
edu.ohsu.cslu.parser.ChartParser} implementations use some {@link
edu.ohsu.cslu.parser.chart.Chart} data structure, of which there are two main
variants: {@link edu.ohsu.cslu.parser.chart.CellChart} and its subclasses
store chart cells as Java objects; {@link
edu.ohsu.cslu.parser.chart.ParallelArrayChart} and its subclasses store the
entire chart as parallel arrays of intrinsics, which is generally more
memory- and cache-efficient, but complicates access somewhat.</p>
