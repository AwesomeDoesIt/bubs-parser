<p>Parser implementations which perform grammar intersection via a
Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication. This operation saves considerable
time for exhaustive inference, and is (minimally) very competitive for
pruned inference as well. These parsers all use matrix-encoded
grammars ({@link edu.ohsu.cslu.grammar.SparseMatrixGrammar}).</p>
