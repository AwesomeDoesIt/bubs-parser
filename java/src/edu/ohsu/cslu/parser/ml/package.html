<p>Parser implementations which use matrix-encoded grammars
({@link edu.ohsu.cslu.grammar.SparseMatrixGrammar}). Most of these
parsers perform exhaustive inference only, but even exhaustive
inference is quite efficient using memory- and cache-efficient
grammar representations. See Dunlop et al. (2010) for further details.</p>
