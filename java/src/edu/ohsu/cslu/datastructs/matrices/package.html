<p>Contains a variety of matrix data structure implementations. These classes are intended for information storage, 
but generally not for linear algebraic manipulations. Integer and floating-point data should generally use 
{@link IntMatrix} and {@link FloatMatrix}, respectively, but if memory usage is more critical than floating-point precision, 
the {@link FixedPointShortMatrix} class consumes 1/2 the memory of {@link FloatMatrix}.</p>
