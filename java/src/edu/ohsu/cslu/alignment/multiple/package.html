<p>Provides multiple-sequence-alignment tools. A truly optimal
multiple-sequence-alignment algorithm is an n-dimensional dynamic
programming problem and is intractable for sets of any size. Most of
these aligners use iterative pairwise techniques instead, which usually
produce good alignments in reasonable time.</p>
